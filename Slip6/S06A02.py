Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm Implementation

Question:
Write a Python program to implement the Depth-First Search algorithm. Refer to the following graph as input for the program.
Initial node: 1
Goal node: 7

Graph Representation:
1 ==> 3 <== 5 ==> 7
\\      //          //          //
 \\    //         //          //
     2 ==> 4 == 6
